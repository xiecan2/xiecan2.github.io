## Research

---

* **Intelligent Media Research Center of Shandong University** —— **Research assistant**

Studying under Associate Professor Song Xuemeng, working in *multimodal information retrieval* and *fashion recommendation*.

Main work during the period:

- **Multimodal irony detection**

  **Task definition:** Given a multimodal social tweet including both text and images, we aim to detect whether there  was an sarcastic emotional tendency.

  **Our work:** We utilize data enhancement methods such as EDA and text translation to eliminate the impact of  noise, and supervised contrast learning is used to train the model to learn the unbiased features of the data as  much as possible. Finally, we test our model on the Out-of-distribution(OOD) data set labeled by ourselves.

  **My contribution:** Responsible for most of the main work, including paper research, reproducing paper code,  model design and Pytorch implementation.


## Projects

---

* **Target detection of agricultural pests based on YOLOv5 model**

  The project uses the YOLOv5 model as the backbone, reduces the number of downsampling by modifying the model structure, and enhances the model capability by using data augmentation techniques. Multi-scale target detection is achieved for pest datasets.

* **Financial Risk Control - Prediction of loan irregularities**

  Data preprocessing, including missing value processing, category-based data processing, feature selection, and data binning, was performed on the loan data. XGBoost and LightGBM models were built, and the effects of the two models were compared after tuning the parameters and training.


## Skills

---

English proficiency：**CET-6: 500**  

Python/C++/Matlab, ability to use PyTorch deep learning framework with Pandas and other data analysis tool libraries.
